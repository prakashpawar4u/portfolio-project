üëã Hello, I'm Prakash!

üöÄ As a seasoned telecom professional with 9 years of hands-on experience, I've honed my skills in Python development and embraced cutting-edge technologies like Docker and Kubernetes. Currently navigating the exciting realms of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, I'm on a journey to become a versatile data scientist.

üåê My GitHub is a canvas where I paint with code, showcasing my love for open source and passion for innovation. From telecom projects that have shaped my career to forays into data science with Python's powerful tools (think Numpy and Pandas), my repositories are a reflection of my technical prowess and commitment to continuous learning.

I have experience in the following programming languages and technologies:
